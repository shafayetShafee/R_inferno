## S3 methods

S3 methods make the `class` attribute the driver of a OO system and it is optional that is, S3 method is only effective for an object if that object has class defined.

There are some function that are generic (e.g. print, plot, summary, lm etc.). Generic functions look for whether its first argument has a class argument and then look for a method of the generic function that matches up the name of the class of the first argument. If such a method exits, then that method function is used. But if no method is found or the argument does not have a class, then the default method of generic function is used.
