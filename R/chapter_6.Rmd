```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```


Doing Global Assignments from inside a function may have bad consequences and therefore, is recommended to avoid global assignments which can be done with `<<-`. 

It is expected that R function would have no side effects. But a function that make global assignments violates this expectation and change a global variable value which is dangerous thing to happend. For example,

```{r}
#| label: globe_assignment

x <- 1
y <- 1

fun <- function() {
  x <- 101
  y <<- 102
}

fun()

x
y
```
